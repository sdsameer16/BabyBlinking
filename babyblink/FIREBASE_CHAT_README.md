## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Firebase Configuration:
- Project ID: `chbot-b64b1`
- Database: Firestore
- Collection structure: `chats/{parentId}/messages`

### Message Structure:
```javascript
{
  id: "auto-generated",
  text: "message content",
  senderId: "parent/caretaker ID",
  senderType: "parent" | "caretaker",
  babyName: "baby's name", // for parent messages
  timestamp: serverTimestamp()
}
```

### Key Features:
- **Real-time messaging**: Uses Firestore `onSnapshot` listeners
- **Message persistence**: All messages are stored in Firestore
- **Parent identification**: Each parent gets a unique ID based on user info
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Responsive design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Professional UI**: Clean, modern interface with animations

## 🔗 Routes

- **Parent Interface**: `/home` → Click "Live Chat" tab
- **Caretaker Dashboard**: `/caretaker` (standalone page)

## 📱 Mobile Compatibility

Both interfaces are fully responsive and work well on mobile devices with touch-friendly interactions.

## 🎯 Key Benefits

1. **Real-time communication**: Instant message delivery
2. **Message persistence**: Chat history is maintained
3. **Multi-parent support**: Caretakers can handle multiple parents
4. **Professional appearance**: Clean, modern UI
5. **Scalable architecture**: Firebase handles scaling automatically
6. **Offline support**: Messages sync when connection is restored
